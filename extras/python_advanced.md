## List Comprehension
- A concise way to create list based on existing list.
- Basic Syntax
```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```
### Example-1: Converting String to Uppercase (Normal vs List Compre)
### Example-2: Finding Even Numbers (Normal vs List Compre)

## Lambda Function
- In Python, a lambda function is an anonymous, one-line function defined with the lambda keyword.
- Unlike a regular function created with def, a lambda function has no name and is limited to a single expression.
- Syntax
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```
### Example-1: Multiplying Value by 2 (Normal Function vs Lambda)
### Example-2: For Math Equation (Normal Function vs Lambda)
### Example-3: For Collections Sorting (sorted) and Filtering (filter)
